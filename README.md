# Recommendor-System-Thesis-Codebase
This repository contains the work for my Master's thesis with Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) on the topic "COMPARISON OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR PERSONAL PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS". The study focuses on evaluating and comparing various machine learning algorithms used for making personalized product recommendations.

**Folders**

**Codebase:** This folder contains the source code used to implement and test different machine learning models. The scripts are organized to facilitate the comparison of algorithms such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Deep Learning Models, Hybrid Recommendation Systems, and Association-Based Learning.

**Data/Pre-processed Data:** This folder is dedicated to storing the datasets used in the study. It includes both raw data and pre-processed data that has been cleaned and prepared for model training and evaluation. The pre-processing steps applied to the raw data are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the various models.
